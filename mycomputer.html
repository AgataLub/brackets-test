            <h1>My First Computer</h1>

                <h2>Early Years</h2>
                <p>The computer I remember using the earliest in my life was Tamagotchi. I was maybe five or six years old. I got it from my parents who didn’t really understand how it work. I remember it was green and it was fun to play with for a short period of time, and then I got bored of it. </p>
                <p>
                    Tamagotchi is a small egg-shaped computer that can be attached to a bag or keys with a small chain. It usually has three buttons and tiny <abbr title="Liquid-Crystal Display">LCS</abbr> screen. It is a simulation game where the user have to take care of virtual pet, feeding it and cleaning after it regularly. If properly taken care of, the pet will grown old and learn new tricks (in the newer versions of Tamagotchi).</p>

                <p>Tamagotchi was created in 1996 in Japan by Akihiro Yokoi and Aki Maita. The original Tamagotchi are produced by Bandai company, however due to the huge popularity of the toy, there is a huge amount of similar toys in the market. </p>

                    The second computer I was using in my life was probably a handheld electronic game also called a “Brick Game”. The one I was laying was probably Chinese or Russian production. It featured 8 buttons, and the rectangular, dot-matrix screen. The brick game allowed you to play up to 20 distinct games, for example:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sudoku</li>
                    <li>Racing games</li>
                    <li><a href="https://tetris.com/" target="_blank">Tetris</a></li>
                    <li>Space Invaders</li>
                    <li>Avoid the falling objects</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>First PC</h2>
                <p>
                    I got my first PC in the age of 10 or 11. It was a PC with Windows XP Professional. I didn’t have the Internet access straight away. My favourite things to do on my new computer was to play video games, use Word, Paint or other programs that came pre-installed at the computer.
                </p>

                <p>That computer had enough of processing power to run programs like Gimp or Winamp, and games like Warcraft III.</p>
