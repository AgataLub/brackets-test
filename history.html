                 <h2>What is it?</h2>
                    <p>The first computers made were big. Room size big. They were also very expensive and pretty slow and you had to be a specialist to program them. So the president of <abbr title="International Business Machines">IBM</abbr>, Thomas Watson, can be forgiven for his infamous quote from 1943: <q>I think there is a world market for maybe five computers.</q></p>

                <h2>The first popular micro computer</h2>

                <p><strong>A micro computer is defined as a computer with a single central processing unit (<abbr title="Central Processing Unit">CPU</abbr>) as a microprocessor.</strong></p>

                <p>Featured on the cover of the magazine Popular Electronics in January 1975 was the <abbr title="Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems">MITS</abbr> Altair 8800 and this started the new era of the micro computer. Limited as it were, it was still widely popular - though mainly amongst geeks. The <abbr title="Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems">MITS</abbr> could be purchased as a DIY project, and when is was assembled it had eight switches that could be used to program it. Each switch represented one bit in the memory register and instructions were made one byte at a time. </p>

                <blockquote>Note: The word <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geek">“geek”</a> originally (in the 16th century) meant a freak (from Dutch “gek” or Low German “geck”), but from 1983 it has been recorded in teenage slang as referring to peers with few social skills but a keen interest in new technology.</blockquote>

                <p>As the micro computers developed and became more advanced, they would have more memory and a build in keyboard. They would also come with some sort of text based interface – typically a specific flavour of a programming language like Basic or something similar. </p>

                <p>One of the most well known micro computers was the ZX81, which came out in 1981. This computer had a wide appeal even though it had no more than 1 Kb of <abbr title="Random Access Memory">RAM</abbr>. Later extension modules became available, so that you could upgrade to either 16 or 64 Kb. With so much <abbr title="Random Access Memory">RAM</abbr> you could type in 64.000 characters of computer code.</p>

                 <img src="images/c64.jpg" alt="White box with black keyboard and 4 grey buttons on the side. The name on the top of the box states Commodore 64.">
                <p>The ZX81 was followed by the ZX Spectrum in 1982. This one came with 16 Kb but could be upgraded to 128 Kb. In order to use it, one would have to connect it to a television set and the resolution you’d see would be 256 x 192 pixels which equals to 32 characters across in 24 lines. <strong>The computer was able to show 8 colours and play five octaves of sound in mono.</strong></p>

                <p>Within the next couple of years a myriad of micro computers hit the marked. They were now becoming known as home computers and they include machines from well known brands like Acorn, Amstrad, Atari, Commodore, Texas and Sinclair. Two brands ended up stealing the scene - and the market: IBM and Apple.</p>

                    <p>The most successful micro computer by far was the Commodore 64. It had an 8 bit microprocessor with a clock frequency at just about 1 megahertz and 64 Kb of RAM. The really extraordinary thing about the <abbr title="Commodore 64">C64</abbr> though was it’s extra graphics chip which was able to show 16 colours, 8 sprites, had scrolling capabilities and a resolution of 320x200 pixels (40x25 characters) and it’s sound chip that could play 8 octaves of sound in 3 channels. The multimedia race had begun (although no one used that word yet).</p>


                <p>The C64 was a keyboard with the computer inside, like most other home computers. It did have several connections on the back through whitch you could connect other types of hardware like joysticks, midi instruments an external storage device and a television set.</p>

                <h2>Software was the edge</h2>

                <p>In the time of the micro computer software were written specifically for each computer, as they all came with their own operating system build into them. Burned into their microchips where the commands that they understood, and programmers needed to write their programs to the specific machine. The amount of software available for a specific computer played a significant role in its success. This is one of the reasons for the huge success of the Commodore 64. With it’s powerful graphics and sound processors it was a perfect platform for games and it gave programmers a strong platform to developed all sorts. Of the more famous ones one could mention:</p>

                <h2>The software operating system</h2>

                <p>A contester to the micro computer was IBM’s so-called Personal Computer or <abbr title="Personal Computer">PC</abbr> although is was much pricier and did not find it’s way into normal homes straight away. was a much began to change as the new <abbr title="International Business Machines">IBM</abbr> <abbr title="Personal Computer">PC</abbr> (<abbr title="Personal Computer">PC</abbr> for Personal Computer) entered the market. The <abbr title="International Business Machines">IBM</abbr> <abbr title="Personal Computer">PC</abbr> used a software operating system. This had to load on startup, but made it easier to update - simply because you did not need to buy a completely new piece of hardware. The <abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr> (for Operating System) was called <abbr title="Microsoft Disk Operating System">MSDOS</abbr>, this was short for Micro-Soft Disk Operating System (yes, they used a dash in their name in the early days). The code was based on the UNIX operating system although greatly simplified.</p>

                <h2>From calculators to communication devices</h2>

                <p>Computers continued to develop. In the micro computer age the computer were mostly used as a very specialized machine. In many cases it was a toy used for gaming or a little bit of home programming. Later that changed, as the internet developed and people began to connect. In the words of Bill Gates, the founder of Microsoft and the developer of <abbr title="Microsoft Disk Operating System">MSDOS:</abbr> <q>I think it's fair to say that personal computers have become the most empowering tool we've ever created. They're tools of communication, they're tools of creativity, and they can be shaped by their user.</q></p>
